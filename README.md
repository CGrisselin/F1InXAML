# F1 In XAML
"F1 In XAML" is a showcase application demoing [Material Design In XAML Toolkit](https://github.com/ButchersBoy/MaterialDesignInXamlToolkit).

Primarily built in conjunction with the 1.5 release of Material Design In XAML Toolkit, this demo serves to illustrate the Transitions API which is introduced in 1.5.

__Note that 1.5 is currently pre-release when installing nuget package__

Admittedly I have plenty of experience with the library - but the demo was built in less than a day, and all transitions used are out of the box, so little knowledge of WPF storyboards/animations is required.
